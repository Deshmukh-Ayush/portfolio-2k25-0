# Understanding Static Site Generation

Static Site Generation (SSG) is a method of pre-rendering web pages at build time, resulting in fast, secure, and scalable websites. Frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby have popularized SSG, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.

## What is Static Site Generation?

SSG generates HTML pages during the build process, rather than on each request. This means users receive fully rendered pages instantly, improving performance and SEO.

## Benefits of SSG

- **Speed**: Pre-built pages load quickly.
- **Security**: No server-side code execution at runtime.
- **Scalability**: Serve static files from a CDN.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Search engines can easily index content.

## SSG in Next.js

Next.js allows you to use SSG with the `getStaticProps` function:

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data at build time
  return { props: { data: "Static Data" } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

## When to Use SSG

- Blogs and documentation sites
- Marketing pages
- Portfolios

## Limitations

- Not ideal for highly dynamic content
- Build times can increase with large sites

## Conclusion

Static Site Generation is a powerful technique for building fast and reliable websites. By understanding its strengths and limitations, you can choose the right rendering method for your next project.
