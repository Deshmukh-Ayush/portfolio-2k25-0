# Building Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system available in modern browsers. It enables developers to create complex, responsive layouts with ease. In this article, we'll explore the basics of CSS Grid and how to use it to build flexible web designs.

## What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It allows you to define rows and columns, and place items precisely within a grid.

## Basic Example

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
gap: 16px;
```

## Responsive Design with Grid

CSS Grid makes it easy to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Combining Grid with Flexbox

Use Grid for overall layout and Flexbox for component alignment within grid items.
